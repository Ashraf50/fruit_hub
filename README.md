# fruit_hub

A new Flutter project.
Fruit Hub is a fruit management and shopping app built using Flutter with a clean code architecture to ensure organized and maintainable development. Bloc and Cubit are used for state management, allowing efficient separation of business logic from the user interface.

# Key Features:
Firebase Authentication: Manages user login and registration, including email/password authentication and Google sign-in.
Firebase Firestore: Stores product and user data in a cloud-based database, enabling real-time updates and product listings.
Firebase Storage: Manages and stores images related to products (such as fruit images).
API Integration: The app fetches external data in JSON format, such as fruit prices or recipes.
App Architecture:
Bloc and Cubit: Bloc is used to manage complex operations like user authentication and data fetching, while Cubit is utilized for simpler state management tasks like UI updates.
Firebase Interaction: Firebase services are accessed through dedicated channels and services, ensuring a clear separation between UI and business logic.
This approach enhances performance and makes the app scalable for future growth.
